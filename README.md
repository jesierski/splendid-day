# splendid-day
Spiced Academy Data Science Graduation - Final Project Flower Recognition

Screenshots see https://careerkarma.com/discussions/projects/flower-type-recognition-815/

Flower images downloaded from https://www.tensorflow.org/ are used to build a Deep Learning model to recognise which kind of flower (daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, tulip) is contained in the image presented. Wrapped up into a Web App. Continuous integration and automated testing is used during development.
